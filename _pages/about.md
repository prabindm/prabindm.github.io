<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Hello! I am Prabin, a Research Assistant Professor in the [Department of Veterinary and Animal Science](https://www.umass.edu/veterinary-animal-sciences/) in the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am a cell biologist and a bioinformatician. 

**My Research**
I am passionate about cancer treatment and prevention. My research focuses on identifying genetic and environmental modifiers of breast cancer using mouse models and developing biomarkers/therapies to advance breast cancer treatment. Our laboratory uses a combination genetic, biochemical, molecular biology and bioinformatics approaches and utilizes cell culture, mouse models and primary breast tissues.

**My Background and history**
I received my PhD in Bioscience and Bioengineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (India). I trained as an enzymologist, purifying and characterizing novel enzymes involved in bioremediation of recalcitrant environmental compounds. As post-doc at the UNMC, Omaha , I studied the role of mucins â€“ a group of transmembrane proteins - in cancer cell signaling. I went back to India to teach in Delhi University and Ravenshaw University. In 2016, I was awarded Raman post-doctoral fellowship  to map the genomic interval (Sm1) identified as suppressing mammary tumor development in mice at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst where I was first a visting scholar, then post-doctoral scholar and continue as a research faculty.
