Hello! I am Prabin, a Research Assistant Professor in the [Department of Veterinary and Animal Science](https://www.umass.edu/veterinary-animal-sciences/) in the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am a cell biologist and a bioinformatician. <br/><br/>

**My Research**

I am passionate about cancer treatment and prevention. My research focuses on identifying genetic and environmental modifiers of breast cancer using mouse models and developing biomarkers/therapies to advance breast cancer treatment. Our laboratory uses a combination genetic, biochemical, molecular biology and bioinformatics approaches and utilizes cell culture, mouse models and primary breast tissues.<br/><br/>

**My Background and history**

I received my PhD in Bioscience and Bioengineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/), India. I trained as an enzymologist, purifying and characterizing novel enzymes involved in bioremediation of recalcitrant environmental compounds. As post-doc at the [University of Nebraska Medical Center](https://www.unmc.edu/biochemistry/), Omaha , I studied the role of mucins â€“ a group of transmembrane proteins - in cancer cell signaling. I went back to India to teach in [Delhi University](https://www.du.ac.in/) and [Ravenshaw University](https://ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/schoolof-life-sciences/). In 2016, I was awarded Raman post-doctoral fellowship  to map the genomic interval (Sm1) identified as suppressing mammary tumor development in mice at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst where I was first a visting scholar, then post-doctoral scholar and continue as a research faculty.
