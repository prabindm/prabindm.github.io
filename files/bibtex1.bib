  abstract = {{MUC}16, precursor of the most widely used ovarian cancer biomarker {CA}125, is upregulated in multiple malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis.

Using different lengths of dual-epitope(N-terminal {FLAG}- and C-terminal {HA}-Tag) tagged C-terminal {MUC}16 fragments, wedemonstrate that {MUC}16 cleavage takes place in the juxta-membrane ectodomain stretchof twelve amino acids that generates a {\textasciitilde} 17 {kDa} cleaved product and isdistinct from the predicted sites. This was further corroborated by domain swappingexperiment. Further, the cleavage of {MUC}16 was found to take place in {theGolgi}/post-Golgi compartments and is dependent on the acidic {pH} in the secretorypathway. A similar pattern of {\textasciitilde} 17 {kDa} cleaved {MUC}16 was observed inmultiple cell types eliminating the possibility of cell type specific phenomenon.{MUC}16-Cter translocates to the nucleus in a cleavage dependent manner and binds tothe chromatin suggesting its involvement in regulation of gene expression. Takentogether, we demonstrate for the first time the oft-predicted cleavage of {MUC}16 thatis critical in designing successful therapeutic interventions based on {MUC}16.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer risk is intimately intertwined with exposure to estrogens. While more than 160 breast cancer risk loci have been identified in humans, genetic interactions with estrogen exposure remain to be established. Strains of rodents exhibit striking differences in their responses to endogenous ovarian estrogens (primarily 17β-estradiol). Similar genetic variation has been observed for synthetic estrogen agonists (ethinyl estradiol) and environmental chemicals that mimic the actions of estrogens (xenoestrogens). This review of literature highlights the extent of variation in responses to estrogens among strains of rodents and compiles the genetic loci underlying pathogenic effects of excessive estrogen signaling. Genetic linkage studies have identified a total of the 35 quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) affecting responses to 17β-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol in five different tissues. However, the {QTL} appear to act in a tissue-specific manner with 9 {QTL} affecting the incidence or latency of mammary tumors induced by 17β-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol. Mammary gland development during puberty is also exquisitely sensitive to the actions of endogenous estrogens. Analysis of mammary ductal growth and branching in 43 strains of inbred mice identified 20 {QTL}. Regions in the human genome orthologous to the mammary development {QTL} harbor loci associated with breast cancer risk or mammographic density. The data demonstrate extensive genetic variation in regulation of estrogen signaling in rodent mammary tissues that alters susceptibility to tumors. Genetic variants in these pathways may identify a subset of women who are especially sensitive to either endogenous estrogens or environmental xenoestrogens and render them at increased risk of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Purpose: {MUC}16, a tumor biomarker and cell surface–associated mucin, is overexpressed in various cancers; however, its role in lung cancer pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we have explored the mechanistic role of {MUC}16 in lung cancer.Experimental Design: To identify the functional role of {MUC}16, stable knockdown was carried in lung cancer cells with two different {shRNAs}. Clinical significance of {MUC}16 was evaluated in lung cancer patient tissues using {IHC}. We have generated genetically engineered mouse model ({KrasG}12D; {AdCre}) to evaluate the preclinical significance of {MUC}16.Results: {MUC}16 was overexpressed (P = 0.03) in lung cancer as compared with normal tissues. {MUC}16 knockdown ({KD}) in lung cancer cell lines decreased the in vitro growth rate (P < 0.05), migration (P < 0.001), and in vivo tumor growth (P = 0.007), whereas overexpression of {MUC}16-carboxyl terminal ({MUC}16-Cter) resulted in increased growth rate (P < 0.001). Transcriptome analysis of {MUC}16 {KD} showed a downregulation (P = 0.005) of {TSPYL}5 gene, which encodes for a testis-specific Y-like protein. Rescue studies via overexpression of {MUC}16-Cter in {MUC}16 {KD} cells showed activation of signaling proteins, such as {JAK}2 (Y1007/1008), {STAT}3 (Y705), and glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}), which constitutes an important axis for the regulation of {TSPYL}5 for oncogenic process. Further, inhibition of {STAT}3 (Y705) led to decreased {GR} and {TSPYL}5, suggesting that {MUC}16 regulates {TSPYL}5 through the {JAK}2/{STAT}3/{GR} axis. Also, {MUC}16 overexpression induced cisplatin and gemcitabine resistance by downregulation of p53.},

We investigated the effect of {BP}-3 and {PP} on estrogen receptor–dependent transactivation and {DNA} damage at concentrations relevant to exposures in humans. In human breast epithelial cells, {DNA} damage following treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2), {BP}-3, and {PP} was determined by immunostaining with antibodies against γ-H2AX and 53BP1. Estrogenic responses were determined using luciferase reporter assays and gene expression. Formation of R-loops was determined with {DNA}: {RNA} hybrid–specific S9.6 antibody. Short-term exposure to the chemicals was also studied in ovariectomized mice. Immunostaining of mouse mammary epithelium was performed to quantify R-loops and {DNA} damage in vivo. Concentrations of 1{μM} and 5{μM} {BP}-3 or {PP} increased {DNA} damage similar to that of E2 treatment in a {ERα}-dependent manner. However, {BP}-3 and {PP} had limited transactivation of target genes at 1{μM} and 5{μM} concentrations. {BP}-3 and {PP} exposure caused R-loop formation in a normal human breast epithelial cell line when {ERα} was introduced. R-loops and {DNA} damage were also detected in mammary epithelial cells of mice treated with {BP}-3 and {PP}. Acute exposure to xenoestrogens ({PP} and {BP}-3) in mice induce {DNA} damage mediated by formation of {ERα}-dependent R-loops at concentrations 10-fold lower than those required for transactivation. Exposure to these xenoestrogens may cause deleterious estrogenic responses, such as {DNA} damage, in susceptible individuals. https://doi.org/10.1289/{EHP}5221},

Furthermore, the association of {MUC}4 expression (by immunohistochemistry) in lung cancer samples with patient survival was evaluated.{ResultsMUC}4-expressing lung cancer cells demonstrated a less proliferative and metastatic phenotype. Up-regulation of p53 in {MUC}4-expressing lung cancer cells led to the accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase of cell cycle progression. {MUC}4 expression attenuated Akt activation and decreased the expression of Cyclins D1 and E, but increased the expression of p21 and p27. {MUC}4 expression abrogated cancer cell migration and invasion by altering N- \& E-cadherin expression and {FAK} phosphorylation. A decrease in {MUC}4 expression was observed with increasing tumor stage (mean composite score: stage I, 2.4; stage {II}, 1.8; stage {III}, 1.4; and metastatic, 1.2; p = 0.0093).

Our previous study using a systematic dual-epitope tagged domain deletion approach of carboxyl-terminal {MUC}16 has demonstrated the generation of a 17-{kDa} cleaved {MUC}16 ({MUC}16-Cter). Here, we demonstrate the functional significance of {MUC}16-Cter in {PC} using the dual-epitope tagged version (N-terminal {FLAG}- and C-terminal {HA}-tag) of 114 carboxyl-terminal residues of {MUC}16 (F114HA). In vitro analyses using F114HA transfected {MiaPaCa}-2 and T3M4 cells showed enhanced proliferation, motility and increased accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase with apoptosis resistance, a feature associated with cancer stem cells ({CSCs}). This was supported by enrichment of {ALDH}+ {CSCs} along with enhanced drug-resistance.

A preponderance of aromatic degradation genes on plasmids, transposons, and integrative genetic elements (and their shuffling through horizontal gene transfer) have lead to the evolution of novel aromatic degradative pathways. This enables the microorganisms to utilize a multitude of aromatics via common routes of degradation leading to metabolic diversity. In this review, we emphasize the exquisiteness and relevance of bacterial degradation of aromatics, interlinked degradative pathways, genetic and metabolic regulation, carbon source preference, and biosurfactant production.

While much remains elusive regarding its origin, it is well established that chemical carcinogens and endogenous estrogens contribute significantly to the initiation and progression of this disease. Rats have been useful models to study induced mammary cancer. They develop mammary tumors with comparable histopathology to humans and exhibit differences in resistance or susceptibility to mammary cancer depending on strain. While some rat strains (e.g., Sprague-Dawley) readily form mammary tumors following treatment with the chemical carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene ({DMBA}), other strains (e.g., Copenhagen) are resistant to {DMBA}-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Genetic linkage in inbred strains has identified strain-specific quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) affecting mammary tumors, via mechanisms that act together to promote or attenuate, and include 24 {QTLs} controlling the outcome of chemical induction, 10 {QTLs} controlling the outcome of estrogen induction, and 4 {QTLs} controlling the outcome of irradiation induction. Moreover, and based on shared factors affecting mammary cancer etiopathogenesis between rats and humans, including orthologous risk regions between both species, rats have served as useful models for identifying methods for breast cancer prediction and treatment. These studies in rats, combined with alternative animal models that more closely mimic advanced stages of breast cancer and/or human lifestyles, will further improve our understanding of this complex disease.},

  abstract = {{PCB} 126 is a pervasive, dioxin-like chemical pollutant which can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ({AhR}). Despite being banned from the market, {PCB} 126 can be detected in breast milk to this day. The extent to which interindividual variation impacts the adverse responses to this chemical in the breast tissue remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of 3 {nM} {PCB} 126 on gene expression in a panel of genetically diverse benign human breast epithelial cell ({HBEC}) cultures and patient derived breast tissues. Six patient derived {HBEC} cultures were treated with 3 {nM} {PCB} 126. {RNAseq} was used to interrogate the impact of exposure on differential gene expression. Gene expression changes from the top critical pathways were confirmed via {qRT}-{PCR} in a larger panel of benign patient derived {HBEC} cultures, as well as in patient-derived breast tissue explant cultures. {RNAseq} analysis of {HBEC} cultures revealed a signature of 144 genes significantly altered by 3 {nM} {PCB} 126 treatment. Confirmation of 8 targets using a panel of 12 {HBEC} cultures and commercially available breast cell lines demonstrated that while the induction of canonical downstream target gene, {CYP}1A1, was consistent across our primary {HBECs}, other genes including {AREG}, S100A8, {IL}1A, {IL}1B, {MMP}7, and {CCL}28 exhibited significant variability across individuals. The dependence on the activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor was confirmed using inhibitors. {PCB} 126 can induce significant and consistent changes in gene expression associated with xenobiotic metabolism in benign breast epithelial cells. Although the induction of most genes was reliant on the {AhR}, significant variability was noted between genes and individuals. These data suggest that there is a bifurcation of the pathway following {AhR} activation that contributes to the variation in interindividual responses.},

  abstract = {Bioorthogonal catalysis via transition metal catalysts ({TMCs}) enables the generation of therapeutics locally through chemical reactions not accessible by biological systems. This localization can enhance the efficacy of anticancer treatment while minimizing off-target effects. The encapsulation of {TMCs} into nanomaterials generates “nanozymes” to activate imaging and therapeutic agents. Here, we report the use of cationic bioorthogonal nanozymes to create localized “drug factories” for cancer therapy in vivo. These nanozymes remained present at the tumor site at least seven days after a single injection due to the interactions between cationic surface ligands and negatively charged cell membranes and tissue components. The prodrug was then administered systemically, and the nanozymes continuously converted the non-toxic molecules into active drugs locally. This strategy substantially reduced the tumor growth in an aggressive breast cancer model, with significantly reduced liver damage compared to traditional chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Early embryonic development is a finely orchestrated process that requires precise regulation of gene expression coordinated with morphogenetic events. {TATA}-box binding protein-associated factors ({TAFs}), integral components of transcription initiation coactivators like {TFIID} and {SAGA}, play a crucial role in this intricate process. Here we show that disruptions in {TAF}5, {TAF}12 and {TAF}13 individually lead to embryonic lethality in the mouse, resulting in overlapping yet distinct phenotypes. Taf5 and Taf12 mutant embryos exhibited a failure to implant post-blastocyst formation, and Taf5 mutants have aberrant lineage specification within the inner cell mass. In contrast, Taf13 mutant embryos successfully implant and form egg-cylinder stages but fail to initiate gastrulation. Strikingly, we observed a depletion of pluripotency factors in {TAF}13-deficient embryos, including {OCT}4, {NANOG} and {SOX}2, highlighting an indispensable role of {TAF}13 in maintaining pluripotency. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene targets affected by the loss of {TAF}5, {TAF}12 and {TAF}13. Thus, we propose that {TAF}5, {TAF}12 and {TAF}13 convey locus specificity to the {TFIID} complex throughout the mouse genome.},

Defining the mechanisms by which {ERα} induces {DNA} damage and initiates tumorigenesis requires normal {HBECs} that express {ERα}, demonstrate estrogenic responses, and are amenable to long term propagation in culture. We utilized lentiviral expression of an inducible {ERα} construct to generate four {HBEC} lines ({HBEC}-{ESR}1). We studied these cells for {ERα}-dependent responses using a luciferase reporter, endogenous gene expression and proliferation assays. {RNA}-Seq was performed to characterize the {ERα}-mediated transcriptomic patterns in the four {HBEC} lines. {ERα} mediated {DNA} double strand breaks ({DSBs}) were analyzed using γH2AX immunofluorescence. Expression and functional activation of {ERα} were observed in all {HBEC}-{ESR}1 lines, whereas proliferation in response to 17β-estradiol (E2) was observed in 3 of the cell lines. Proliferative responses were due to intrinsic signaling within the {HBECs} as conditioned media from the cells failed to cause proliferation. A total of 682 genes were differentially expressed at 24h following treatment with 10nM E2 with 43\% of these genes were also observed in {ERα}+ breast cancer cell lines ({MCF}7 or T47D). Gene-set enrichment analysis identified differential expression of genes in {ERα} signaling pathways and {DNA} repair pathways in E2-treated cells. E2-induced {ERα} signaling also increased γH2AX foci in 3 of the 4 cell lines. Levels of {DSBs} were increased by inhibition of the non-homologous end-joining ({NHEJ}) and homologous recombination ({HR}) pathways. {DSBs} were also increased in {MCF}10A-{ESR}1 cells heterozygous for the {BRCA}1185delAG mutation causing a truncated protein. Inducible expression of {ERα} in immortalized {HBECs} recapitulate transcriptional, replicative and {DNA} damage responses. Increased {DSBs} in {MCF}10A-{ESR}1 cells with heterozygous mutation of {BRCA}1 indicate haploinsufficiency and the potential for increased genetic instability due to {ERα} signaling.},
